In proof theory and formal logic, a **fixpoint** refers to a value or state that remains unchanged under a given operation or transformation. Fixpoints are crucial in various logical frameworks, particularly in the context of reasoning about recursive definitions, self-referential statements, and iterative processes.

### **Fixpoint in Proofs:**
1. **Definition**:
   - A **fixpoint** of a function \( f \) is an input \( x \) such that \( f(x) = x \).
   - In logic and proof systems, this concept applies to statements, predicates, or processes that stabilize at some value or truth condition.

2. **Use in Proofs**:
   - **Defining Recursive Concepts**: Fixpoints are used to formalize the meaning of recursive definitions, like in arithmetic (e.g., factorials) or inductive proofs.
   - **Fixed-Point Theorems**: Results such as the **Knaster-Tarski Theorem** or **Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem** provide conditions under which fixpoints exist in logical systems.
   - **Self-Referential Proofs**: Fixpoints are essential in Gödel's incompleteness theorems and the formalization of self-referential statements, like "This statement is false."
   - **Iterative Proof Systems**: Many proof systems involve iterative processes (e.g., constructing the least fixpoint of a predicate) to establish results.

### **Examples of Fixpoints in Logic:**

#### 1. **Inductive Definitions**:
   - In defining natural numbers:
     - Base case: \( 0 \) is a natural number.
     - Inductive case: If \( n \) is a natural number, then \( n+1 \) is also a natural number.
   - The set of natural numbers is the **least fixpoint** of this definition because it stabilizes under the operation of "adding \( n+1 \)."

#### 2. **Truth in Modal Logic**:
   - Statements in modal logic (e.g., \( \Box P \), meaning "necessarily \( P \)") may stabilize at a fixpoint where the truth value no longer changes under further application of modal operators.

#### 3. **Fixed-Point Theorems in Formal Systems**:
   - Gödel’s incompleteness theorem relies on constructing a self-referential statement via the **fixed-point lemma**:
     - For a formal system \( S \), there exists a sentence \( G \) such that \( G \leftrightarrow \neg \mathrm{Prov}(G) \), where \( \mathrm{Prov}(G) \) means "G is provable in \( S \)."
     - \( G \) is a fixpoint of the operation mapping statements to their provability conditions.

### **Types of Fixpoints**:
1. **Least Fixpoint**:
   - The smallest solution that satisfies a recursive or inductive definition.
   - Common in inductive reasoning (e.g., defining natural numbers).

2. **Greatest Fixpoint**:
   - The largest solution to a recursive definition.
   - Often used in coinductive reasoning (e.g., defining infinite structures like streams).

---

### **Applications in Proofs**:
- **Proof Automation**:
  - Fixpoints help automate reasoning in tools like theorem provers, where recursive definitions are common.
- **Mathematical Logic**:
  - Used to model self-referential and circular reasoning.
- **Formal Verification**:
  - Fixpoints underpin reasoning about systems with loops or recursive processes.

---

### **In Summary**:
Fixpoints in proofs provide a foundational concept for reasoning about recursion, iteration, and self-reference. They are vital for defining and proving properties of objects that are constructed iteratively or have circular dependencies.
