(* Mathematical Fact: The harmonic series sum H_n approximates ln(n) + Î³ (Euler-Mascheroni constant) for large n.
   H_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n.
*)

(* Algorithm: Compute the harmonic series sum up to n terms *)
Fixpoint harmonic_series (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 0
  | S n' => harmonic_series n' + 1 / (S n')
  end.

(* Theorem: Harmonic series grows asymptotically as ln(n) *)
Theorem harmonic_series_growth :
  forall n : nat, (harmonic_series n >= ln (S n))%R.
Proof.
  (* Requires real number analysis and definitions *)
Admitted. (* This theorem would require Coq's real number library for full proof. *)
