# Isabelle

> Okay, the user is asking about automated theorem proving in Coq and Isabelle. Let me recall what I know about these tools. Coq and Isabelle are proof assistants used for formal verification. They allow users to define theorems and construct proofs step by step, often with some level of automation.
  First, I need to explain how automated theorem proving works in both Coq and Isabelle. The user wants code examples, so I should provide snippets for each. Let me start with Coq. In Coq, you can use tactics like auto, intuition, or omega to automate parts of the proof. For example, proving a simple logical tautology like commutativity of AND. I'll write a Coq script that states the theorem and uses tactics to prove it.
  Next, Isabelle. Isabelle/HOL is another proof assistant with powerful automation tools like simp, auto, and blast. I'll need to show a similar example in Isabelle, maybe the same commutativity theorem. Using the theorem prover setup and the appropriate commands.
  Wait, the user mentioned "automated theorem proof in code," so I should make sure the examples are simple and demonstrate automation. Also, highlight the key differences between Coq and Isabelle. Coq uses dependent types and is more focused on constructive proofs, while Isabelle/HOL is higher-order logic and has different automation mechanisms.
  I should also mention the prerequisites for each, like installing the software and understanding the syntax. Maybe add some notes about the ecosystem, such as Coq's SSReflect for more advanced proofs or Isabelle's sledgehammer for integrating external provers.
  Let me check if the examples I have in mind are correct. For Coq, the commutativity of AND is straightforward. Using split to handle the conjunction and auto to solve each subgoal. In Isabelle, using the simplifier or auto tactic should suffice.
  I need to explain each part of the code so the user understands what's happening. Also, maybe include a more complex example, like the associativity of addition, to show how induction and automation work together.
  Wait, the user might not be familiar with the syntax, so comments in the code would help. Also, note that these are simplified examples and real-world usage can be more complex.
  Finally, wrap it up with a comparison table and some resources for further learning. Make sure to highlight that while these tools have automation, constructing proofs still requires human guidance, especially for complex theorems.

##  Here are examples of **automated theorem proving** in Coq and Isabelle/HOL, two leading proof assistants. These tools combine human-guided proof steps with automated tactics:

---

### **1. Coq Example: Commutativity of Logical AND**
```coq
(* Define the theorem *)
Theorem and_comm : forall A B : Prop, A /\ B -> B /\ A.
Proof.
  (* Automated proof using intuition tactic *)
  intuition.
  - destruct H; auto.  (* Break conjunction and solve *)
  - destruct H; auto.
Qed.

(* More automated version *)
Theorem and_comm_auto : forall A B : Prop, A /\ B -> B /\ A.
Proof. tauto. Qed.  (* Fully automated by tauto tactic *)
```

#### Key Features:
- `intuition`: Automated handling of intuitionistic logic
- `tauto`: Complete tautology checker
- Dependency management through Gallina language

### **2. Isabelle/HOL Example: Associativity of Addition**
```isabelle
theory Addition
imports Main
begin

(* Automated proof of associativity *)
lemma add_assoc: "(a + b) + c = a + (b + (c::nat))"
  apply (induct a)  (* Start induction on 'a' *)
   apply auto       (* Base case automation *)
  apply (induct b)  (* Nested induction *)
   apply auto       (* Automation for recursive case *)
  done

(* Fully automated version *)
lemma add_assoc_auto: "(a + b) + c = a + (b + (c::nat))"
  by (induct a; induct b; simp_all)

end
```

#### Key Features:
- `apply auto`: Isabelle's built-in simplifier/auto prover
- `simp_all`: Powerful simplification tactics
- Structured Isar proof language

  | S (S m as p) => fib p + fib m
  end.
